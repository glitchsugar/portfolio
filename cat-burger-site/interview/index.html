  <p class="intro">
    On Monday, March 22, 2021, JW interviewed Ro about the object Cat Burger, the subject of their focus throughout the Spring 2021 semester of Design. 
	</p>
  
  <!-- Question 1 by Student 1 -- Write the first question using the format below: 
    Student Name: lorem ipsum dolor sit? -->
  <p class="w"><span class="j">JW:</span> How did you acquire cat burger?</p>

  <!-- Answer 1 by Student 2 --  Write the first answer using the format below: 
    Student Name: lorem ipsum dolor sit. -->
  <p class="o"><span class="r">Ro:</span> I got him on a road trip, at a gas station, at, like, 2 AM, and just, I had to have it!</p>

  <!-- Question 2 by Student 1 -->
  <p class="w"><span class="j">JW:</span> What kind of material is it made from? Is it the kind of material that when you press it it rises back slowly or...?</p>

  <!-- Answer 2 by Student 2 -->
  <p class="o"><span class="r">Ro:</span> I'm pretty sure it's foam! When you squish it it does take a while to fully re-inflate? Refill? I don't know, but it does it fairly quickly, just takes a hot second</p>

  <!-- Question 3 by Student 1 -->
  <p class="w3"><span class="j">JW:</span> Is the foam itself colored or is there, like, a layer of paint coating it or something like that? </p>

  <!-- Answer 3 by Student 2 -->
  <p class="o"><span class="r">Ro:</span> I'm not entirely sure. Cat burger is chipped in some areas and it's a milky yellow type color under that, but under other areas you can see the orange coming through so maybe it's painted but in several layers? The only way to be sure is to cut open cat burger and it's not worth it.</p>

  <!-- Question 4 by Student 1 -->
  <p class="w"><span class="j">JW:</span> Have you seen a design like cat burger anywhere before? Like in shows or online or anywhere or is it a unique character? </p>

  <!-- Answer 4 by Student 2 -->
  <p class="o"><span class="r">Ro:</span> Until this project I hadn't really seen another cat burger until I googled it and found a bunch of websites selling them! </p>
